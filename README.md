# Batch Normalization

This project is part of **UdacityÂ´s Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program**. Here you will find my personal solution to the challenge. The following project can be run using a Local Machine or using an external GPU (Solution provided by **Amazon Web Services** is recommended). Next, you can follow Udacitys instructions to install the necessary dependencies on a local machine or on AWS.

Batch normalization is a technique for improving the performance and stability of neural networks. The idea is to normalize the layer inputs such that they have a mean of zero and variance of one, much like how we standardize the inputs to networks. Batch normalization is necessary to make DCGANs work.

Follow the instructions to install the required environment and check the jupyter notebook files:

    (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook Batch_Normalization_Exercises.ipynb
    
    (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook Batch_Normalization_Lesson.ipynb
    
    (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook Batch_Normalization_Solutions.ipynb

### Instructions - Udacity Project

## Project Requirements
To fully test the project, you might need to install some required packages. Please start by downloading **Anaconda** using the following link: [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Once installed, clone this repository and access the downloaded folder through a **terminal** window. Next, you need to install the required packages:

Start by cloning this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pablomateo/BatchNorm.git
    
Then access the downloaded folder:

    $ cd BatchNorm
    
Create the necessary **Conda Environment**:

    $ conda env create -f pmaienv.yml
    
Once all the packages have been installed, activate the environment:

    $ source activate pmaienv
    
Once finished, you can run my personal version of this project

     (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook Intro_to_GANs_Exercises.ipynb
    
You can also check the solutions file

     (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook Intro_to_GANs_Solution.ipynb
